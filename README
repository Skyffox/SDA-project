Scientific Data Analysis project:

The following packages are required to fully run the Jupyter Notebook:

conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg

This package is used to run the gif in the notebook.

conda install -c conda-forge basemap

This package is used to draw a map of the world and translate our latitude and longitude 
values to coordinates used by this library to accurately represent them on the worldmap.

We have had several issues when trying to use the basemap libary. We had installed the Basemap 
package in our root virtual environment. But apparently the Basemap package relies on the proj.4 env 
variable to be set. Which does not work if you are working in a root environment. So we implemented 
a dirty fix to set the missing variable. This fix is implemented in the notebook. If this fix does 
not work when reviewing the code, you may have to try the following installers:

conda install -c anaconda basemap 

or

sudo apt-get install libgeos-3.X.X
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev
pip install --user https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/archive/master.zip

If these also do not work, we have included the figures in the /figures map. The gif of attacks over 
the years has also been included. But this video (when downloaded) seemed to not show the entire process which is due to a fault of the library.
